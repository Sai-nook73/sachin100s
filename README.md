## 100 Centuries of Sachin Tendulkar

Sachin Tendulkar is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest cricketers the world has seen. This is a timeline of his 100 centuries, created using rCharts and TimelineJS.

This timeline chart is fully reproducible using the code [here](code.R). You will need to have the `dev` version of rCharts installed to make this work.

```coffee
require(devtools)
install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev')
```
